Hi, I am Hanyang Chen, in Chinese it's 陈翰扬, you can also call me Jeremy. I am a final-year undergrad student in The University of Hong Kong. I tried to explore those that interest me and hopefully exhibit value to others, where the most prominent one is AI. I am fornuate to advised by [Dr.Yanchao Yang](https://datascience.hku.hk/people/yanchao-yang/) and we just finished a work on Representatiion Learning this summer. I am also fornuate to be advised by [Prof.Yi Ma](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/) and [Dr.Xili Dai](https://delay-xili.github.io/) for my final year project on sparse coding and closed-loop transcription. Utilizing AI algorithms to facilitate life interests me, includes Representation learning, Embodied AI, Large model and Robotics. I am planning to pursue a further degree in AI research, let's see where life takes my curiosity to.
